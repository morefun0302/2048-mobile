# 2048

[Play the original here!](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/)

This is a fork of the original 2048 clone. This version is used in the iOS app "Number 2048" to be released soon. Wrapper is not available to the public.

It required changes to communicate with Titanium, and HTML has been stripped down to just the game-board.

You can use this fork as you like, but I recommend you use the original
